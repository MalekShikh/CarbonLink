Day 1: Watched: [How does Bluetooth Work? (Branch Education)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I1vxu5qIUM)   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Core Concepts: Bluetooth uses a range of 2.4835 GHz to a 2.4 GHz or a 120.7 mm to 124.9 mm wavelength.  
This range is split into 79 different channels, which bluetooth switches through as it transfers information.  
This is to avoid noise and traffic sent out by other devices or routers as they also use the same wavelength. It is also used to prevent eavesdropping  
(Routers split the wavelength into only 14 channels.)  
When information is sent, it is sent as a packet, its size ranging from 250 to a thousand bits.
The packet is split into three parts, the access codes where it establishes connectiona dn synchronizes with the device, making sure it is the correct  
one, the header which is information about the bits in the packet, and the payload, which delivers the music or files to the other device.  
Frequency Shift Keying: The shift in frequency which is assigned to a 1 or a 0 to send data.
Device only sends one wave, the carrier wave, which shifts in frequency.
Phase Shift Keying: Another method to transfer data, changes the direction or speed of the wave and the intensity of it is assigned to a value.
